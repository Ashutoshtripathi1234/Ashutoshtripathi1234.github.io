            My name is Ashutosh Tripathi, and I am a final-year Bachelor of Technology student in Electronics Engineering at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, India, with a CGPA of 8.10.
            I am writing to express my keen interest in pursuing a PhD under your esteemed supervision.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my studies, I have honed my programming skills in Python and C, gaining proficiency in libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch.
            I have hands-on experience developing AI models, deep learning applications, and leveraging tools like Power BI and FastAPI for data analysis and solution deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a research assistant at institutions like The University of Hong Kong and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, I worked on analyzing large language models (LLMs) and designing federated learning algorithms for cross-domain tasks.
            My research extended to video classification and multimodal fusion, where I explored attention-based architectures for improved model performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have co-authored 10 papers for conferences such as AAAI and ICDM, and journals like TMLR and Applied Soft Computing. Notably, I published work in the MICCAI 2024 conference and IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, focusing on federated learning and medical image classification:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MICCAI 2024:</strong> <em>FedMRL: Data Heterogeneity Aware Federated Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Medical Imaging</em></li>
                <li><strong>IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics:</strong> <em>AdaFedProx: A Heterogeneity-Aware Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Medical Image Classification</em></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond research, I have led projects such as developing a CNN-based handwritten character recognition model and a heart disease prediction system using deep neural networks. I also worked on AI-based IoT applications and reinforcement learning models for UAV systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am confident that my research experience and technical skills would allow me to contribute effectively to your research group.
